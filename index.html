                         among triathlon. It is a breathtaking process that ordinary people cannot dare to dare to overcome human 
                         limitations. In fact, even those who exercise cannot hastily challenge without sufficient preparation.
                          However, there is a person who participates in such a fierce game every month.

                  <p>The best time to work out is whenever you can fit it in! Have a look at your schedule and figure out what time of day is best for you.
                    If your routine is flexible, think about when you feel most energetic, or when you would prefer to exercise. Morning workouts can be an energising way to start the day for some, while others prefer working out in the afternoons or evenings. 
                    Consistency is what matters, so focus on working out when it works best for you, which will make it more enjoyable and easier to stick to! </p>

                  <p>You bet! We know it can be tempting to get straight into it, especially if you’re short on time, but a proper warm-up is really important. 
                    According to the Mayo Clinic, warming up and cooling down may help reduce your risk of injury and improve performance. A good warm-up prepares your body for activity, raises your body temperature and increases blood flow to your muscles.
                    A simple warm-up can be five minutes of cardio or some dynamic stretching of the muscles you are about to use. Each workout in the Sweat app comes with optional warm-ups you can follow. </p>

              <div class="content">
                  <p>We recommend a mixture of cardio and strength training.
                    Alternating between the two is a good way to find balance. 
                    Why both and not just one? Because you want to reap the benefits of each! 
                    According to the American Cancer Society, two to three strength-based workouts each week can result
                     in significant health benefits, such as increased muscle mass, stronger bones, boosted metabolism,
                      better posture, balance and joint flexibility. Research shows it also can boost heart health and have a
                       positive impact on your mental health.</p>
